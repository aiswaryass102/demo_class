        <p>Riaz has been the target of trolls, who have been dropping negative comments under her posts, from calling her ‘dark,’ ‘heavy,’ and ’not pretty,’ to suggesting she use glutathione injections, and saying, ‘Shakal se toh tu Indian lag rahi hai (You look like an Indian).’</p>
        <p>On November 10, Riaz finally responded to the criticism that had been directed her way by sharing a video on Instagram, and said, “My skin is the same colour as the soil of Pakistan, the same colour as the women who built our families, our homes.”</p>
