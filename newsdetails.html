    <p>The meeting comes just days after the Bangladesh's foreign ministry in a statement urged India to extradite “fugitive accused” Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile in India since her ouster as prime minister in August 2024.</p>
    <p>The Bangladesh government had cited an extradition agreement with India and said it was an “obligatory responsibility” for New Delhi to ensure the return of Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal.</p>
